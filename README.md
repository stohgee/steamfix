# steamfix
This is intended to be a collection of fixes to address issues running Steam Apps.

This repository is cloned from a local webserver "gamebox" thats configured to look for `./.page.md`.

Here on GitHub, these pages will be renamed `./readme.md` so GitHub embeds the Markdown content.

Information comes from all sources, so the goal is to try and document where information was sourced from.
A majority if not all content will not be originally created by me (stohgee) or possibly other contributors.
